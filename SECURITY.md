# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Issues

The Nexocoin project takes security seriously.

If you discover a security vulnerability or potential issue in the Nexocoin protocol, implementation, or documentation, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

Please do **not** open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, report security concerns privately by contacting:

**Email:** security@nexocoin.org  
*(temporary contact: repository owner via GitHub private communication)*

If an official security contact is updated, this document will be revised accordingly.

### Scope

This security policy applies to:

- The Nexocoin protocol specification
- Consensus and networking logic
- Transaction validation rules
- Economic and security models
- Reference implementations and documentation

### Disclosure Process

- Security reports will be reviewed privately
- Valid issues will be addressed as appropriate
- Public disclosure, if any, will occur only after mitigation

# Nexocoin

Nexocoin is a native Layer-1 cryptocurrency with its own blockchain, consensus mechanism, and economic model.  
It is not a token and does not rely on any external network.

Nexocoin is a decentralized blockchain protocol designed to provide a secure, efficient, and transparent digital value system.

The project focuses on protocol simplicity, deterministic behavior, and long-term sustainability, following proven principles established by first-generation blockchain networks while introducing a modern and modular architecture.

## Overview

Nexocoin is a Layer-1 blockchain with its own native network, consensus rules, and execution model.  
It is not a token and does not rely on external blockchains.

Core design goals:

- Deterministic and transparent protocol rules
- Native consensus and mining process
- Simple and auditable economic model
- Clear separation between protocol, network, and documentation
- Long-term stability over short-term complexity

---

## Key Characteristics

- Independent blockchain network
- Native coin (NXC)
- On-chain state model
- Peer-to-peer network
- Public and verifiable ledger
- Protocol-first design

---

## Documentation

The complete technical documentation of the Nexocoin protocol is available in the `/docs` directory:

 **[Protocol Documentation](./docs/README.md)**

It includes detailed specifications of:
- Protocol architecture
- Consensus mechanism
- Mining and emissions
- Transactions
- Networking
- Security model
- Economic and supply model
- Fees and gas system
- Wallet structure

---

## Project Status

Nexocoin is an active blockchain project under continuous development and documentation.

This repository serves as the **official reference implementation and documentation source** for the Nexocoin protocol.

---

## Philosophy

Nexocoin follows a conservative and transparent approach:

- No hidden protocol rules
- No privileged protocol behavior
- No opaque mechanisms
- Everything defined by code and documentation

The protocol is designed to be understandable, auditable, and reproducible.
